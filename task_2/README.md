# task_2

Enhance the result of the previous task and add some user interactions.

The goal is to add currency selection functionality so that:
- when the user clicks on one of the currencies, it should add and display it in the list of selected currencies
- if the currency is already selected, it should unselect the currency and remove it from the list of selected currencies
- in addition, when the user clicks on the dark remove icon - "X" (the top-right icon on a selected currency item), it should unselect the currency and remove it from the list of selected currencies
